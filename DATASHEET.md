The degree of rounding for latitude and longitude depends on the precision you need for your application. Each decimal place in latitude and longitude represents a different level of precision:

1 decimal place: ≈ 11.1 km (or ≈ 6.9 miles)
2 decimal places: ≈ 1.11 km (or ≈ 0.69 miles)
3 decimal places: ≈ 111 meters (or ≈ 364 feet)
4 decimal places: ≈ 11 meters (or ≈ 36 feet)
5 decimal places: ≈ 1.11 meters (or ≈ 3.6 feet)
6 decimal places: ≈ 11 cm (or ≈ 4.3 inches)
7 decimal places: ≈ 1.1 cm (or ≈ 0.43 inches)
For most applications, rounding to 5 or 6 decimal places is sufficient for accurate positioning,
